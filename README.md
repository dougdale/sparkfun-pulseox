# sparkfun-pulseox
Pulse oximeter project using SparkFun module and OLED display

This program, in it's original version, is basically a port of the SparkFun example code for the [SparkFun Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Monitor Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-pulse-oximeter-and-heart-rate-monitor-hookup-guide) (and therefore carries the same license). This version sends the output to the SparkFun Qwiic OLED instead of the serial port.
